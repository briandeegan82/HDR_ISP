# BrilliantISP / HDR-ISP

This project is a derivative work based on [Infinite-ISP](https://github.com/10x-Engineers/Infinite-ISP) by 10xEngineers, which in turn is based on FastOpenISP and OpenISP. Standing on the shoulders of giants.

**License**: Apache License 2.0 (see LICENSE and NOTICE files)

## Features

- **Decompanding (PWC)**: Linearizes companded sensor data for HDR pipelines
- **Tone mapping** (before or after demosaic):
  - `durand` – Durand bilateral-filter local TMO
  - `aces` – ACES filmic (float)
  - `aces_integer` – ACES via LUT (production-style)
  - `hable` / `hable_integer` – Hable/Uncharted 2 filmic
  - `reinhard_integer` – Reinhard global operator (integer / fixed-point friendly)
- **Lens shading correction**: Radial polynomial per-channel vignetting correction
- **Gamma correction**: Power curve or sRGB OETF (IEC 61966-2-1)
- Config-driven pipeline; HDR-aware bit depths
- Optional GPU acceleration (BNR, Durand TMO, scale, sharpen)

## Instructions

Run the pipeline:

```bash
python isp_pipeline.py
```

Parameters are defined in config YAML files (e.g. `config/svs_cam.yml`). Set `CONFIG_PATH` and `RAW_DATA` in `isp_pipeline.py` for your setup.

## Configuration

See `config/base_hdr.yml` (defaults) and a camera overlay such as `config/AD_cam.yml` — files named `*_cam.yml` merge on top of `base_hdr.yml` automatically. Key sections:

- `tone_mapping` – `tone_mapper`: durand, aces, aces_integer, hable, hable_integer, reinhard_integer
- `gamma_correction` – `curve`: gamma or srgb
- `lens_shading_correction` – radial k1/k2 per channel

## Documentation
